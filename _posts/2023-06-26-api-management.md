[Research](https://www.akamai.com/newsroom/press-release/state-of-the-internet-security-retail-attacks-and-api-traffic)
conducted by [Akamai](https://www.akamai.com) indicates that the
majority of internet traffic is attributable to API calls indicating
the wide-scale adoption of API based architectures and
solutions. Cloud support for creating, securing, deploying, and
monitoring APIs is provided by AWS, Azure, and GCP in different
levels. However, GCP stand-outs as providing more flexible solutions
depending on the requirements for the solution. For example, all three
cloud providers offer a fully managed platform which takes care not
only of the full lifecycle of API development but also ensuring high
availability and reliability.

The API management solutions can be categorised into three groups:

1. **Fully Managed API Management Solution**: unified platforms for building,
training, and deploying AI/ML models,
2. **AI Infrastructure**: Dedicated hardware to develop and run AI workloads,
3. **AI for Developers**: Machine Learning SaaS and APIs which
developers can integrate into their applications to build AI services
and applications,
4. **Managed AI Solutions**: Predefined managed AI solutions for
   industry applications.
