From a conceptual perspective, AWS, Azure, and GCP offer equivalent
products and services. Cloud Equivalence aims to be a facilitating
tool for cloud practioners to enable them to build conceptual bridges
between one cloud provider platform and others. Such a conceptual map
could assist with architecture activity such as multi-cloud
architecture design, SaaS evaluation across cloud providers, or even
cross cloud platform training.
