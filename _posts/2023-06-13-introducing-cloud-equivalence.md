At a conceptual level, AWS, Azure and GCP offer equivalent products
and services. Cloud Equivalence aims to be a facilitating tool for cloud
practioners to enable them to build conceptual bridges between one
cloud provider and others, and thereby reduce the time and effort required
to get up to speed with an unfamilar cloud platform and its associated
products and services.
