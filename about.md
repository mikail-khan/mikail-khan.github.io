The leading cloud providers, at a conceptual level at least, offer
similar cloud products and services. Enterprises increasingly seek to
adopt multi-cloud strategies primarily to avoid vendor lock-in, but
also to take advantage of best-of-breed solutions with a particular
cloud provider. Consequently, this poses a challenge for cloud
practioners who may have expertise in one cloud provider platform but
not in any other(s). Cloud Equivalence aims to provide a comparitive
study of the concepts, technologies, and services provided by the
three main cloud providers. It is not a competitive analysis of the
major cloud providers, but rather aims to be a helpful tool to bridge
cloud concepts from one cloud provider platform to another.
